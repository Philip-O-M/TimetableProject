# Introduction

Timetabulous is a timetable creation application that is intended to ease the challenges of timetable creation faced in educational institutions. The application will use the genetic algorithm to allow university administrators to design clash-free timetables by providing the system with constraints, namely Lecturer times, rooms, total hours for lessons and Subjects available. The application also aims to reduce the chance of errors made by keeping members of the system current and up to date with each other via communication channels focussed on the scheduling tasks of the institutions.
